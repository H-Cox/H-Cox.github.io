I"U	<p>Hello, world!</p>

<p>I am currently in my third year of a Biological Physics PhD at the University of Manchester, using state-of-the-art microscopy techniques to further the understanding of peptide self-assembly. My work is important as peptide self-assembly is thought to be involved in the development of horrible diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, also the structures formed by self-assembling peptides have good potential to be used as medicine themselves; in wound healing, drug delivery or as anti-microbial agents. I have created this site to help me share more detailed information about some of the work I have done academically but also some personal projects that I have going.</p>

<p>If you are interested in my academic work then I recommend you have a look at my recent publication, which was my first as first author and featured on the front cover of Biomacromolecules. It was the culmination of the first year and a half of my PhD, where I developed techniques to image self-assembling peptide fibril networks using STORM, a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique with 20 nm resolution. You can access the article for free <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.biomac.7b00465">here</a>. If you have any specific questions about the technique or the sample then <a href="mailto:henryfcox@live.com">contact me</a>.</p>

<p>I began my PhD with no real programming experience, however over the course of the last three years I have written and used hundreds of MatLab scripts to perform advanced modelling and analysis of the data I have collected. Often involving combining data from multiple sources, and performing complex image analysis. This has given me a taste for developing my skills further and so I have begun to write small programs, primarily in python, to help hone my skills. Most of these are uploaded to my <a href="https://github.com/h-cox">GitHub page</a> and I plan to rewrite some of these (potentially in ruby and with TDD techniques) in future.</p>

<p>Look out for more detailed posts about specific aspects of my PhD and personal projects in the future. If you are interested you can also take a look at my <a href="../CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
