Over the past three years I have done a lot of super-resolution imaging using the STORM microscopy that was built in the Photon Science Institute at the University of Manchester.

####The diffraction limit and the need for super-resolution

With a little money you can try to achieve higher resolution camera images by upgrading your cameras sensor or lens. However, the diffraction limit usually will play a part eventually, and is generally the limiting factor in many modern camera lenses. It is also the dominant limiting factor in the resolution of microscopes.

Diffraction occurs when light passes through a hole (or aperture) and causes the light rays to spread out. You can read more about it [here][diffraction]. The spreading out of light as it passes through the lens makes objects appear blurry and thus limits the resolution of your camera or microscope.

The diffraction limit for some of the most state-of-the-art microscope lenses operating with visible light is approximately 250 nm. Although this might sound small, biological samples can be very small and when we want to image the structures and processes going on within bacteria and cells a resolution of 250 nm is often not enough.

####Super-resolution imaging

With the advent of modern computing power and image processing techniques super-resolution imaging has been born to attempt to beat the classical diffraction limit.

There have been a few different methods that have been used to
