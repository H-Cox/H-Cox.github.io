henrycox.co.uk is back!  I know there are lots of readers out there so everyone must be very happy to see it is back.

I hope to start some semi-regular posting with fun and interesting content.  The aim being to put a smile on at least one face or contribute something positive to the internet.  We will see how it goes... 

Here is a photo of my cat in the meantime:
