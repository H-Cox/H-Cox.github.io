I will keep this page updated with the details of my published academic work.

### Single-molecule study of peptide gel dynamics demonstrates states of pre-stress
<b>Henry Cox</b>, Hai Xu, Thomas A. Waigh, and Jian R. Lu, *Langmuir*, **2018**

**DOI:** [10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b03334][Prestress article]

My second major peice of work as first author. In this article I present about 9 months work which involved videoing the thermal motion of the peptide fibrils in a gel (the same as fibrils as in my 2017 Biomacromolecules article). I used open contour snakes algorithms to track the position of the fibrils with an accuracy of approximately 20 nm in each frame of the video. I then used Fourier decomposition to separate out contributions to the fibrils curvature from stresses imposed by the network and the fibrils intrinsic properties. This revealed that pre-stresses dominated the fibril curvature in many cases.

This finding is significant as the mechanical properties of the network depend on the stresses within them and previously there had been little experimental evidence for pre-stresses such as those I have measured. These kinds of networks turn up all over biology and are an active area of research due to the possibility of using them to deliver localised doses of drugs (e.g. to a cancer tumour). For these applications very specific mechanical responses are necessary and so it will be very important to consider the stress in the network to make an effective treatment.

### Self-assembly of mesoscopic peptide surfactant fibrils investigated by STORM super-resolution fluorescence microscopy
<b>Henry Cox</b>, Pantelis Georgiades, Hai Xu, Thomas A. Waigh, and Jian R. Lu, *Biomacromolecules*, **2017**, *18* (11), pp 3481–3491

**DOI:** [10.1021/acs.biomac.7b00465][STORM article]

This was my first published article and you can read it open access [here][STORM article]. This was the first major piece of work that I completed as part of my PhD and it featured on the [front cover][STORM cover] of the journal. In this work I developed the methodology to image the 3D networks formed by the synthetic peptide I<sub>3</sub> K using the super-resolution imaging technique called STORM. This was the first time that these type of samples have been imaged in this way and allowed the exchange kinetics of peptides in the network to be measured. These kinds of measurements help to inform models for the assembly of similar peptides into fibrils, which is relevant to the mechanism of amyloid formation in many common nuerodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

As part of this work I got my first taste of working with large data sets. STORM is a reconstruction technique that requires tens of thousands of images of the sample to be recorded and then processed with an algorithm. I learnt the techniques for processing, filtering and visualising this data and then used the images to extract quantitative information about the properties of the fibrils in them. I also did a small Monte Carlo simulation as part of the work to test my results.

### Other articles

#### Quenched Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (qSTORM) with Graphene Oxide
Ruiheng Li, Pantelis Georgiades, <b>Henry Cox</b>, Sorasak Phanphak, Ian S. Roberts, Thomas A. Waigh and Jian R. Lu, *Scientific Reports*, **2018**, *8*, 16928

**DOI:** [10.1038/s41598-018-35297-4][qSTORM]

This article by Ruiheng demonstrates a method for coating glass coverslips with Graphene Oxide (GO) in order to improve image quality and signal to noise in fluorescence microscopy experiments. In this work I helped Ruiheng by performing experiments with his GO coated coverslips and my peptide fibrils. The idea behind the work is that GO can effectively "turn off" the fluorescent dye molecules that generate the light for microscopy images, however it only does so if the dye is less than 10 nm from the GO. Therefore, by coating the glass with GO we can turn off all the random fluorescent material that might be attached to the glass and otherwise cause background fluorescence. As the samples we use are typically bigger than 10 nm they do not get turned off by the GO and we have a lovely clear image.
