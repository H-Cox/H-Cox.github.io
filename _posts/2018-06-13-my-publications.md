I will keep this page updated with the details of my published academic work.

### Self-assembly of mesoscopic peptide surfactant fibrils investigated by STORM super-resolution fluorescence microscopy
Henry Cox, Pantelis Georgiades, Hai Xu, Thomas A. Waigh, and Jian R. Lu, *Biomacromolecules*, **2017**, *18* (11), pp 3481–3491

**DOI:** [10.1021/acs.biomac.7b00465][STORM article]

This was my first published article and you can read it open access [here][STORM article]. This was the first major piece of work that I completed as part of my PhD and it featured on the [front cover][STORM cover] of the journal. In this work I developed the methodology to image the 3D networks formed by the synthetic peptide I<sub>3</sub> K using the super-resolution imaging technique called STORM. This was the first time that these type of samples have been imaged in this way and allowed the exchange kinetics of peptides in the network to be measured. These kinds of measurements help to inform models for the assembly of similar peptides into fibrils, which is relevant to the mechanism of amyloid formation in many common nuerodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

As part of this work I got my first taste of working with large data sets. STORM is a reconstruction technique that requires tens of thousands of images of the sample to be recorded and then processed with an algorithm. I learnt the techniques for processing, filtering and visualising this data and then used the images to extract quantitative information about the properties of the fibrils in them. I also did a small Monte Carlo simulation as part of the work to test my results.
