This is a website which I am creating so that I can share interesting work or projects which I have done and am doing. The majority of this will also feature on my [GitHub account][h-cox-github], as does this website infact.

Alongside my github account and the content on this site, you may also be interested to see my CV, which you can find [here][Henry Cox CV].
