Hello, world!

I am currently in my third year of a Biological Physics PhD at the University of Manchester, using state-of-the-art microscopy techniques to further the understanding of peptide self-assembly. My work is important as peptide self-assembly is thought to be involved in the development of horrible diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, also the structures formed by self-assembling peptides have good potential to be used as medicine themselves; in wound healing, drug delivery or as anti-microbial agents. I have created this site to help me share more detailed information about some of the work I have done academically but also some personal projects that I have going.

If you are interested in my academic work then I recommend you have a look at my recent publication, which was my first as first author and featured on the front cover of Biomacromolecules. It was the culmination of the first year and a half of my PhD, where I developed techniques to image self-assembling peptide fibril networks using STORM, a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique with 20 nm resolution. You can access the article for free [here][STORM paper]. If you have any specific questions about the technique or the sample then [contact me][my email].

I began my PhD with no real programming experience, however over the course of the last three years I have written and used hundreds of MatLab scripts to perform advanced modelling and analysis of the data I have collected. Often involving combining data from multiple sources, and performing complex image analysis. This has given me a taste for developing my skills further and so I have begun to write small programs, primarily in python, to help hone my skills. Most of these are uploaded to my [GitHub page][GitHub] and I plan to rewrite some of these (potentially in ruby and with TDD techniques) in future.

Look out for more detailed posts about specific aspects of my PhD and personal projects in the future. If you are interested you can also take a look at my [CV](../CV-Henry-Cox-2018-10.pdf).

Thanks for reading!
